4. Populate the project files with a minimum of the below manifest of files.
5. Begin conversing with the AI.

## Initial Files

1. ***Full Timeline.*** Construct a full timeline of your chronic issue. Provide as much detail as possible, including all medical events and symptoms, even if they don't seem relevant. A rule of thumb with chronic health issues is this: **Assume that any symptom or event is relevant until proven otherwise.**
2. ***Lab Work.*** Document all medical tests and diagnosis, including dates. This might need to be separate files.
3. ***Symptoms.*** Separately, document all symptoms you have experienced or are experiencing (include dates, severity, etc).

## Additional Files

Over time, you'll add new files, such as logs and journal entires, new tests, and so on. It will vary based upon your specific needs.
