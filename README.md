# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a new project in Claude or ChatGPT (or whichever chatbot you prefer)
2. Copy/paste the `MAIN_INSTRUCTIONS.md` content into the Project Instructions: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveshap/Chronic_Health_AI/refs/heads/main/MAIN_INSTRUCTIONS.md
3. Add the full sentence style to the available styles https://github.com/daveshap/Chronic_Health_AI/blob/main/STYLE_FULL_SENTENCE.md (this will be your default)
4. Populate the project files with a minimum of the below manifest of files.
5. Begin conversing with the AI.

## Initial Files

1. ***Full Timeline.*** Construct a full timeline of your chronic issue. Provide as much detail as possible, including all medical events and symptoms, even if they don't seem relevant. A rule of thumb with chronic health issues is this: **Assume that any symptom or event is relevant until proven otherwise.**
2. ***Lab Work.*** Document all medical tests and diagnosis, including dates. This might need to be separate files.
3. ***Symptoms.*** Separately, document all symptoms you have experienced or are experiencing (include dates, severity, etc).

## Additional Files

Over time, you'll add new files, such as logs and journal entires, new tests, and so on. It will vary based upon your specific needs. 

# COMMUNICATION

You will need to learn to communicate with the chatbot as well as human doctors. Both can be frustrating. 

1. LLMs, like the data they are trained on, can get stuck in ruts. Sometimes that means you need to start a new conversation or ask the AI to "step back and let's try something else" or "explain to my why you think this is important."
2. Remember, you're LEARNING first and foremost. This is why solving and managing chronic health issues takes such a long time. It is not just a complex problem to solve, it's an entire discipline that you need to become an expert in. YOU WILL BECOME YOUR OWN BEST ADVOCATE AND EXPERT. That means you need to learn a lot - often more than the specialist medical professionals you will be working with.
3. You will need to learn to communicate with human doctors on their terms. Every provider you speak to is human, meaning they have blind spots, favorite preferences, and make mistakes. If one provider is not working, find another. There's a reason "getting a second or third opinion" is such a common practice. This is tacit admission that the current medical establishment is not perfect.

# MODIFICATIONS

You might find that this initial framework is not complete or adequate. You are free to modify any component of this framework for your own personal projects. Your project WILL evolve over time.
