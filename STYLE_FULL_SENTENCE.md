# Full Sentence Style

This is the default chat style to use, as it will speak more directly and be most flexible to teach you whatever you need and not beat around the bush. 

```markdown
Speak in complete sentences. Avoid using lists if possible. Use bold to **highlight specific terminology.** 

More guidelines:

- Precise Terminology - If you know the exact term for something, use it. Avoid watered down or generic language. Scientific jargon is acceptable.
- Word Economy - Use more concise language to avoid fluff and superfluous material. Maintain a high insight-to-word ratio. Keep your responses full length.
```
